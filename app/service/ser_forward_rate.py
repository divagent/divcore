"""Same-day forward-yield refresh for the calendar list.

The homepage "Forward Rate" column is the forward dividend yield (%) priced at
the LATEST price (`regularMarketPrice` — live when the market's open, else the
last close; the same basis as the predict path's `facts.price`). The Google
Calendar event is the cache: each event carries forwardRate / forwardYield /
price / priceAsOf in its private props.

`enrich_forward_rates` is the lazy refresh: for every symbol on the list whose
cached value isn't from today, the first viewer of the day fetches Yahoo once,
computes the yield, patches it back onto the events, and returns it. A second
viewer that day finds priceAsOf == today already stamped and does zero fetches
(publish-time writes also stamp priceAsOf == today, so freshly predicted symbols
are skipped too). All best-effort — Yahoo/Calendar hiccups just leave "—".
